i want to add here the following:

Shows ECS + Fargate knowledge

Shows env vars vs secrets separation

Shows health checks

Shows CloudWatch logging

No Terraform required yet

This alone is enough to say:

“I’ve deployed containerized FastAPI apps on AWS ECS.”

✅ Final checklist (commit-ready)

You now have:
